# How?

<!-- The challenge? How can we write a tool which will be able to handle data extraction from all this data? -->

---

<img src="./resources/program-power-query.webp"/>

<!-- Many people's first go-to is PowerQuery -->

---

## Problem

<video src="./resources/powerquery-data.mp4" controls autoplay />

<!--
  You'll run into an issue because you'll need to handle this awful datastructure. I have seen some people clear this but it can be quite mind bending, and you'll have to do a different transformation for each version. Surely there's an easier way?!
-->

---

# Solution:
## VBA

<!-- The solution is using VBA -->

---

Initial solution

<img src="./resources/create-paths-table.png"/>

<!-- A naive solution might look like this. We create a paths table, and ensure it's name is set correctly -->

---

<img src="./resources/ensure-sheet-named-correctly.png"/>

<!-- We also ensure the sheet itself is named `shPaths` -->

---

Initial solution

```vb
Dim results as Collection
Dim lo as ListObject: set lo = shPaths.ListObjects("Paths")

Dim vPaths: vPaths = lo.Range.Value
Dim i as long
For i = 2 to Ubound(vPaths,1)
  With Workbooks.open(vPaths(i,1))
    Dim sh as Worksheet
    For each sh in .worksheets
      With sh
        results.add Array(.[E8], .[E9], .[N8], .[N11])
      End with
    next
    .Close false
  End With
next
```

<!-- Then we add the following code -->

---

```vb {data-line-numbers="|1-3|5,6,16|7,14|8,9,13|10-12|15"}
Dim results as Collection
Dim lo as ListObject: set lo = shPaths.ListObjects("Paths")
Dim vPaths: vPaths = lo.Range.Value

Dim i as long
For i = 2 to Ubound(vPaths,1)
  With Workbooks.open(vPaths(i,1))
    Dim sh as Worksheet
    For each sh in .worksheets
      With sh
        results.add Array(.[E8], .[E9], .[N8], .[N11])
      End with
    next
  End With
  .Close false
next
```
<!-- We get the file paths from the recently created table. -->
<!-- We loop over each workbook path. -->
<!-- Open it. -->
<!-- Loop through each sheet. -->
<!-- And assign results to our array, before finally -->
<!-- closing the workbook. -->

<!-- This currently doesn't handle different versions of the workbook/sheet however, so...  -->

---

```vb {data-line-numbers="10|24-31|11-18"}
Dim results as Collection
Dim lo as ListObject: set lo = shPaths.ListObjects("Paths")
Dim vPaths: vPaths = lo.Range.Value

Dim i as long
For i = 2 to Ubound(vPaths,1)
  With Workbooks.open(vPaths(i,1))
    Dim sh as Worksheet
    For each sh in .worksheets
      Dim iVersion as Long: iVersion = getVersion(sh)
      With sh
        select case iVersion
          case 1
            results.add Array(.[E8], .[E9], .[E11]/.[E12], .[N8], .[N11])
          case 2
            results.add Array(.[E9], .[E10], .[E10]/.[E11], .[D17], .[D20])
        end select
      End With
    next
    .Close false
  End With
next

Function getVersion(ByVal sh as Worksheet) as Long
  select case true
    case [I4] = "Version: 1.0.0"
      getVersion = 1
    case [I4] = "Version: 1.1.0"
      getVersion = 2
  end select
End Function
```

<!-- We could obtain the version using a function named `getVersion` -->
<!-- Of which the definition would check certain cell references determining the version number -->
<!-- And then perform a different extraction algorithm based on the version number identified -->

---

# TODO:

<!-- 
Now this is a fairly trivial VBA script and with 29 lines of code it will likely suffice for most VBA users. There are still several issues:
* We aren't printing the data anywhere
* We currently don't handle corrupt workbooks
* We currently don't provide user feedback
* Users will be asked to update links
* Users will see a strobing as extracts run
but these can be added with relative ease.

-->

<h1 style="font-size: 1000%">ü§î</h1>

<!-- But what about Excel users. Users who are intimidated by VBA? Can we turn this into a tool which even they can use? Many users are familiar with formulas, so it's not like there's a massive barrier. -->

---

<h1 style="font-size: 1000%">üñºÔ∏è</h1>

<!-- If we give them a UI, can they do it for themselves? Finally wouldn't it be so much better to have a generic tool? It was for this reason I made a more generic version. TODO: this ok? -->

<!-- One will be the categories table, in charge of categorising sheets processed. This is analagous to our "getVersion" function earlier. Users can supply as many rules as they like to distinguish sheets from each other -->

<!-- 
So here we have the code for xrExtractor's main sub routine.
* We first start by creating wrappers around the Paths, Categories, Rules tables, and create our Results array.
* NB. The paths object is using a handy function in stdVBA's stdEnumerator class to obtain an enumerator of Dictionary objects.
* Next we create a new application instance. This allows us to disable various alerts, macros, etc. which might slow down the processing of the workbooks.
* Next we loop over all paths
* Check if the path hasn't been processed yet
* If not it will open the workbook and start iterating over the worksheets.
* Using forceOpenWorkbook ensures we can handle corrupt workbooks too.
* Next, we obtain the category of the sheet
* and if that category is identified, we'll run the extraction rules and add them to our results.
* Finally after all paths have been processed we'll export all results to the workbook and close the newly created application.

Hello and welcome everyone to stdVBA, the gateway to modern vba programming.
In this series we'll go over everything you need to know to get started using stdVBA.

VBA hasn't seen a active development since 1999, with the exception of a single 1-off 64-bit upgrade in 2010.

This leaves VBA in the difficult position where it's legacy technology, while still playing a major part in business logistics worldwide.

stdVBA is designed to bridge this gap. stdVBA is

* Mature: with almost 5 years behind it.
* Stable: with no major breaking changes in recent years
* Actively maintained: with a number of developers posting fixes to the library.
* Familiar: with APIs closely following JavaScript and Ruby
* Extensive: From data structures, to parsers, to automation libraries and concurrency.
* Open Source: With an MIT license allowing anyone to profit from the libraries code.


In this series, we'll dive into each module within the library, explore their features, and show you how to make the most of stdVBA in your projects. These tutorials are mainly designed for those with intermediate VBA knowledge, and we won't be diving into the basics of VBA in this video series.

Stay tuned for our next video, where weâ€™ll start exploring the core libraries of stdVBA and its structure.

Thank you for watching
